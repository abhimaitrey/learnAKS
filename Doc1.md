# Learn AKS â€“ Doc 1
## Create a Resource Group
<code>az group create -l eastus2 -n AKS-rg</code>

Resource group name: AKS-rg
Location: East US2

## Create a AKS cluster using Azure Portal
It takes some time to create a cluster so be patient.
 

## Get the AKS credentials in the local Kubernetes config file for future uses
<code>az aks get-credentials -g AKS-rg --name aksdemo001</code>

Example: resource group name is AKS-rg and Azure Kubernetes Cluster name is aksdemo001

Output:
Merged "aksdemo001" as current context in C:\Users\MAITREY\.kube\config

# List out the existing Kubernetes worker nodes

<code>kubectl get nodes</code>
Or 
<code>kubectl get no</code>
Or
<code>kubectl get node</code>
 
# List all the available namespaces

The namespace is a logical grouping of kubernetes resources like pods and deployments. By default Kubernetes gives following 4 types of namespaces:
1. default - it is used in small environments and used when no other namespace is specified
2. kube-system - it is reserved for core resources and ideally should not deploy your own applications into it.
3. kube-public - generally not used but can be used for resources that is to be visible across the whole cluster and can also be viewed by any user.
4. kube-node-lease - for third party device monitoring plugins

<code>kubectl get ns</code> 
Or
<code>kubectl get namespaces</code>

* Please note : you also can create a namespace as per the requirement.
